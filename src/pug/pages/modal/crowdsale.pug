        |  and soon we hope, partners!
      p.text At Nodio we agree on a saying that only by making something you truly believe in one can become happy and successful. We are a team of dreamers united by an idea of a safe future, where our right to privacy and freedom of speech are respected. For us, Nodio is a tool to fix what is broken today by the people, who are obsessed with power. The main idea behind the project is 
        span.important decentralization
        |  from the corrupted digital world, where multibillion-dollar companies and governmental agencies took over control. It might sound too radical but in reality, our mission can be accomplished with the help of only two precious resources. One is - technology, and we already have it due to an ingenious invention called blockchain. Its possibilities are endless, and people have just started discovering them. The second vital resource is - 
        span.important YOU
        |  as a part of our growing community. We need support from the people with the same values as ours, to start our quest. We cherish your interest in our project and want to create a safe community for individuals who are in control of their data, possessions, and privacy. We have decided to reach this goal by distributing 
        span.important 10%
        |  of Nodio LTD to you. By starting a crowdsale, we want to connect with our supporters and bring this project to life.

      p.text Of course, good things always come in pairs, so you have a chance not only to join the great cause but also significantly improve your financial position.

        .important This 10% Mean?

      p.text We placing 10% of Nodio Technologies value on a crowdsale - this means that we are selling this part without having a fixed price. After the crowdsale you will receive Nod tokens, their number will vary depending on this rate:

      p.text.important 10% = 1 000 000 Nod Tokens (Nods). 

      p.text The more people will chip in - the larger will be the value of the company. This way we will have a bigger funding which will ensure that every step of product's journey (choice of parts, production, marketing, etc.) will be performed at a highest possible level. This will guarantee a smooth launch of the product and a fast return of investments, followed by profitability.
